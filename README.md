# The React Quiz App

The React Quiz App is a quiz application designed to help you practice and enhance your knowledge of React, a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. This app provides a selection of questions related to React, allowing you to test yourself and solidify your understanding of the framework.

## Features

- Quiz Questions: The app offers a range of quiz questions related to React.
- Local Server API: The quiz questions are fetched from a local server API. The server setup uses "json-server," which watches the "data/questions.json" file and runs on port 9000.
- Immediate Feedback: Upon answering each question, the app provides instant feedback, informing you whether your response is correct or incorrect.
- Score Tracking: The React Quiz App keeps track of your score as you progress through the quiz, allowing you to assess your performance.

### Note: this app was built during "The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More" (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/). The course's instructor provided the CSS design, and I implemented the JavaScript and JSX following the guidance in the course videos.
